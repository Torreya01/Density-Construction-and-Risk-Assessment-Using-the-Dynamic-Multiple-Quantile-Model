# Density Construction and Risk Assessment Using the Dynamic Multiple Quantile Model
## Thesis description
The thesis utilised the Dynamic Multiple Quantile (DMQ) model to estimate 99 quantiles for Apple Inc. and FTSE 100 Index returns for each day from June 2014, to June, 2024. 
Then applied the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method to construct smooth density out of these quantiles. The Extreme Value Theory (EVT) was then employed to analyse the tail behaviour of the density plots.
This thesis provides a fundamental framework for future research and practical applications in financial market analysis, paving the way for more sophisticated risk management tools and strategies in the future.
